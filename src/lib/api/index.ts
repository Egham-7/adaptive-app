/**
 * API clients for interacting with the Adaptive backend
 *
 * This module provides a structured approach to API communication:
 * - BaseApiClient: Foundation class with common HTTP methods
 * - Specialized clients: Extend BaseApiClient for specific endpoints
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```ts
 * import { ApiKeysClient } from '@/lib/api';
 * import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
 *
 * const { getToken } = useAuth();
 * const token = await getToken();
 * const client = new ApiKeysClient(token);
 * const keys = await client.list();
 * ```
